# event-scheduler
This project is a smart event scheduler that uses advanced data structures and algorithms to automatically resolve scheduling conflicts.
Users can submit multiple event requests for the same venue and dateâ€”even with overlapping times and different priorities. The backend detects conflicts and, using quadratic hashing and other scheduling strategies, finds the best available time slots for each event. High-priority events always keep their original slots, while others are automatically rescheduled to avoid overlaps.
